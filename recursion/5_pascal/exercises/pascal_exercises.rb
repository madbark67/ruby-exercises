def pascal(row_number)
  # Pascal's triangle is modeled as follows:
  # - The first row is `1`.
  # - Each row can be considered to have a hidden `0` to either sides of it. So the first row could also be said to be `0, 1, 0`
  # - To obtain the next row, we take each number and add it with its rightmost neighbor.
  #
  # First row: `[1]`
  # Second row: `[0+1, 1+0]` or simply `[1, 1]`
  # Third row: `[0+1, 1+1, 1+0]` or simply `[1, 2, 1]`
  # Fourth row: `[0+1, 1+2, 2+1, 1+0]` or simply `[1, 3, 3, 1]`
  #
  #
  # The pattern continues forever.
  #
  # Your task is to create a *recursive* function, `pascal` - that will take an input `n` and output the `n`th pascal's row as an array of numbers.
  #
  # For example, `pascal(3)` should return `[1, 2, 1]`.
